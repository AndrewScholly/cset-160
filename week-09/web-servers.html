# Web Servers

Confusing term used for both the .eight[hardware] or the .eight[software]

- As .eight[hardware], it means a computer that runs web server software along with hosting the files for a site. It must be configured to allow connections from other devices.
- As .eight[software], it means a program that communicates in HTTP allowing users to request a URL and respond with a file.

---

# Web Servers

Can be .eight[static] or .eight[dynamic]

- .eight[Static] servers send the requested file "as-is"
- .eight[Dynamic] servers use extra software, usually an application and/or a database, to translate the request and compute a response.

Most dynamic servers can also handle requests for static files, like stylesheets or images.

# Common Web Servers

As of February 2019:

1. Apache: 44.3%
2. nginx: 41.0%
3. IIS: 8.9%
4. LiteSpeed: 3.9%
5. GWS: 0.9%

Others are used on less than 1% of all websites.

name: http

# Basic HTTP

Imagine you request .eight[http://www.example.com/path/file.html] in your browser. The browser translates that to the following HTTP request:

```http
GET /path/file.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

The web server running on .eight[www.example.com] will match that to a file on the machine, something like:

```md
/home/www/path/file.html
```

---

# HTTP Request

Composed of:

- Request line: method, path to resource, version
- Header fields: host (required), language, cookies, etc.
- An empty line
- An optional message body

Sent as plain-text ASCII.

---

# HTTP Request Methods 

The _verb_ used for the given Uniform Resource Locator

- .eight[GET]: retrieve resource
- .eight[HEAD]: retrieve resource's headers (i.e. meta-data)
- .eleven[POST]: accept data for new resource
- .eleven[PUT]: accept data to update existing resource
- .eleven[PATCH]: accept partial data to update existing resource

---

# HTTP Request Methods 

- .eleven[DELETE]: delete existing resource
- .eight[OPTIONS]: check for allowed methods of a URL
- Others are rarely used, like TRACE and CONNECT

By convention, .eight[Safe Methods] shouldn't change anything on the server while the .eleven[other methods] are intended to cause a side effect.

---

# HTTP Response

Composed of:

- Status line: status code and message
- Header fields: content-type, content-security-policy, etc.
- An empty line
- An optional message body

---
name: status-codes

# Status Codes

Three digit code to describe how the request was handled by the server. They are grouped by the first digit:

- .eight[1XX] codes are Informational
- .eight[2XX] codes are Successful
- .eight[3XX] codes are Redirections
- .eight[4XX] codes are an error from the Client
- .eight[5XX] codes are an error from the Server
