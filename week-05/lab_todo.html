  <h1>
    Lab 05: To-Do Manager
  </h1>

  <hr>

  <p>
    In this lab, you'll combine your knowledge of OOP and the ability to read and write files using Python scripts. Up till now, your code runs once and then forgets everything it did until you run it again. But we can save some of that information in files as a makeshift database.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The goal:</strong> to create a script that manages your to-do list. It should be able to print a list of them to the terminal, to add new items to the list, and to mark items as completed.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Requirements
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Make a class called <code>Item</code>. Objects of this class should have the following attributes:
      <ul>
        <li>A timestamp of when they were created.</li>
        <li>A boolean marking the item as completed or not.</li>
        <li>And the text of the actual to-do item.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Make a class called <code>Manager</code>. A single object of this class should be created when you run your script. It should do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Print all of the to-do items in the list.</li>
        <li>Add a new item to the list.</li>
        <li>Mark an item as completed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Each class should be in its own module which you will need to import accordingly. The main file should be called <code>todos.py</code> and is the only file to be run as a script.</li>
    <li>Your to-do list should be stored in a file called <code>todos.txt</code>. You should never need to edit this file directly, the script should do that for you.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>
    Things to Think About
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>You'll have to figure out how to store data in the file. Spend some time figuring this out. How will you retrieve the data from the file? How will it be organized so you can break the data into separate values? How can you convert that data into different Python types?</li>
    <li>You've never worked with dates or times in Python before. Look up the <code>datetime</code> module in the standard library and see how it can help.</li>
    <li>How will your script work? Will it expect arguments to be passed to it? Or will it run like an interactive program like our games?</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>
    Submit
  </h2>

  <p>You'll create a git repo called <code>todo-manager</code> to hold all <strong>four</strong> of your files. Commit early and often. (If you don't know what I mean, look it up.) You'll submit a link to your git repo to the CSET-160 channel in Discord by:</p>
